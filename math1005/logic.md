# Logic

**Statement**: A sentence that is true or false but not both.

**Tautology**: A statement that is always true

**Contradiction:** A statement that is always false

**Logical Equivalence: **When two statements $$f$$ and $$g$$ are equivalent, we write $$f\equiv g$$.

### Proof Techniques

**Converse**

$$q \implies p$$ is the **converse **of $$p \implies q$$

I.e. The reverse

**Contrapositive**

$$\neg q \implies \neg p$$ is the **contrapositive **of $$p \implies q$$

I.e. negated converse.

**Inverse**

$$\neg p \implies \neg q$$ is the **inverse **of $$p \implies q$$

I.e. negated.

### Equivalencies

$$(p \implies q)\equiv (\neg q \implies \neg p)$$. An implication is equivalent to it's contrapositive.

$$(q \implies p)\equiv (\neg p \implies \neg q)$$. The converse & inverse of an implication are equivalent.

$$(p\implies q)\not\equiv (q\implies p)$$. An implication is **not **equivalent to it's converse.

### If & Only If

$$p\iff q \equiv (p\implies q)\wedge (q \implies p)\equiv (p\implies q)\wedge (\neg p \implies \neg q)$$

So $$p$$ if and only if $$q$$ is true only if `p` implies `q` and `q` implies `p`.

### Valid Arguments

p is **sufficient condition **for q means $$p \implies q$$

p is a **necessary condition **for q means $$\neg p \implies \neg q$$

Since $$(\neg p \implies \neg q) \equiv (q \implies p)$$ we can say

p is a **necessary condition **for q means $$q \implies p$$

p is a **necessary & sufficient condition **for q means $$p \iff q$$
