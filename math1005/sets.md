# Sets

A set is an **unordered **collection of **elements**. When $$x$$ is an element of set $$S$$, we write $$x\in S$$.

### Defining Sets

#### Listing

A set can be described by explicitly listing it's elements, e.g. $$S=\{1,2,3\}$$

#### Set Builder

A set can be described by providing a domain and predicate, e.g. $$S=\{x\in\mathbb{N} | P(x)\}$$

#### Function

Through a function signature and definition, e.g. $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$ and $$f(x) = x^2$$

### Subsets

When every member of set $$A$$ is also a member of set $$B$$, we write $$A\subseteq B$$.

When a set $$A$$ is a subset of set $$B$$ and $$A\neq B$$, we write $$A\subset B$$ and say that $$A$$ is a **proper subset **of $$B$$.

A subset $$\subseteq$$ is the set theoretic analogue to implies $$\implies$$ in logic.

### Universe of Discourse

All sets are a subset of a set $$U$$, called the 'universe of discourse' or 'universal set'. It contains all objects that are relevant to the discussion.
