# Sets

A set is an **unordered **collection of **elements**. When $$x$$ is an element of set $$S$$, we write $$x\in S$$.

### Defining Sets

#### Listing

A set can be described by explicitly listing it's elements, e.g. $$S=\{1,2,3\}$$

#### Set Builder

A set can be described by providing a domain and predicate, e.g. $$S=\{x\in\mathbb{N} | P(x)\}$$

#### Function

Through a function signature and definition, e.g. $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$ and $$f(x) = x^2$$
