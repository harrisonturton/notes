# Data Science

**Data Science **is a science that uses computer science, statistics, machine learning, dataviz ...

### Goals

Turn _data _into _data products._

* Data -&gt; exploratory analysis -&gt; knowledge models -&gt; product / decision making
* Data -&gt; predictive models -&gt; evaluate / interpret -&gt; product / decision making

### Difficulties

* Overcoming assumptions
* Making ad-hoc explanations of data patterns \(not necessarily correct\)
* Overgeneralizing
* Communication
* Not checking enough \(validation, data pipeline integrity etc\)
* Using statistical tests correctly
* Prototype to Product transitions
* Data pipeline complexity

### Why Python

* Rapid prototyping
* Improved library support for data science \(_Fantastic_ tooling\)
  * `numpy`
  * `scipy`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `pandas`
  * Many more...
* Strong High Performance Computation support
  * `cpython`, `numba`
  * Load balancing tasks
  * MP, GPU
  * MapReduce

#### Course Environment

* Anaconda
* Python 3.6
* All modules needed come pre-installed with Anaconda
* Will use Jupyter notebooks as our working environment
